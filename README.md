# Welcome to Chorus Miner!

Chorus Miner is a Minecraft mod, originally developped for version 1.20.1 using Forge 47. It allows simple, infinite generation of materials using Chorus Fruit as fuel.

## How to use
A **Chorus Miner** can be crafted with the following recipe:

Once crafted, it can be used much like other block entities. Feed it Chorus Fruit and watch it cook!

An **Ender Geode** will be produced once **16** **Chorus Fruit** have been consumed. **Ender Geodes** stack up to **16**, so make sure you pull them out of there every once in a while!  

Though Chorus Fruit can be difficult to acquire, there are ways around this - https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Chorus_fruit_farming
